.. _haproxy-conf:

Configuring Load Balancing with HAProxy
=======================================

Percona XtraDB Cluster Operator provides a choice of two cluster components to
provide load balancing and proxy service: you can use either `HAProxy <https://haproxy.org>`_ or `ProxySQL <https://proxysql.com/>`_.
You can control which one to use, if any, by enabling or disabling via the
``haproxy.enabled`` and ``proxysql.enabled`` options in the ``deploy/cr.yaml``
configuration file. 

Use the following command to enable HAProxy:

.. code:: bash

   kubectl patch pxc cluster1 --type=merge --patch '{
     "spec": {
        "haproxy": {
           "enabled": true,
           "size": 3,
           "image": "percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator:{{{release}}}-haproxy" },
        "proxysql": { "enabled": false }
     }}'

.. note:: For obvious reasons the Operator will not allow the simultaneous
   enabling of both HAProxy and ProxySQL.

The resulting HAPproxy setup will contain two services:

* ``cluster1-haproxy`` service listening on ports 3306 (MySQL) and 3309 (the `proxy protocol <https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy/proxy-protocol/>`_).
  This service is pointing to the number zero PXC member (``cluster1-pxc-0``) by
  default when this member is available. If a zero member is not available,
  members are selected in descending order of their numbers (e.g.
  ``cluster1-pxc-2``, then ``cluster1-pxc-1``, etc.). This service can be used
  for both read and write load, or it can also be used just for write load
  (single writer mode) in setups with split write and read loads.

* ``cluster1-haproxy-replicas`` listening on port 3306 (MySQL).
  This service selects PXC members to serve queries following the Round Robin
  load balancing algorithm.

When the cluster with HAProxy is upgraded, the following steps
take place. First, reader members are upgraded one by one: the Operator waits
until the upgraded PXC member becomes synced, and then
proceeds to upgrade the next member. When the upgrade is finished for all 
the readers, then the writer PXC member is finally upgraded.

.. _haproxy-conf-custom:

Passing custom configuration options to HAProxy
-----------------------------------------------

You can pass custom configuration to HAProxy using the ``haproxy.configuration``
key in the ``deploy/cr.yaml`` file. 

.. note:: If you specify a custom HAProxy configuration in this way, the
   Operator doesn't provide its own HAProxy configuration file. That's why you
   should specify either a full set of configuration options or nothing.

Here is an example of HAProxy configuration passed through ``deploy/cr.yaml``:

.. code:: yaml

   ...
   haproxy:
       enabled: true
       size: 3
       image: percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator:1.5.0-haproxy
       configuration: |
         global
           maxconn 2048
           external-check
           stats socket /var/run/haproxy.sock mode 600 expose-fd listeners level user
         defaults
           log global
           mode tcp
           retries 10
           timeout client 10000
           timeout connect 100500
           timeout server 10000
         frontend galera-in
           bind *:3309 accept-proxy
           bind *:3306
           mode tcp
           option clitcpka
           default_backend galera-nodes
         frontend galera-replica-in
           bind *:3309 accept-proxy
           bind *:3307
           mode tcp
           option clitcpka
           default_backend galera-replica-nodes
    ...

.. _haproxy-conf-protocol:

Enabling the Proxy protocol
-----------------------------------------------

The Proxy protocol `allows <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/flexibility/proxy_protocol_support.html>`_
HAProxy to provide a real client address to Percona XtraDB Cluster.

.. note:: To use this feature, you should have a Percona XtraDB Cluster image
   version ``8.0.21`` or newer.

Normally Proxy protocol is disabled, and Percona XtraDB Cluster sees the IP
address of the proxying server (HAProxy) instead of the real client address.
But there are scenarios when making real client IP-address visible for Percona
XtraDB Cluster is important: e.g. it allows to have privilege grants based on
client/application address, and significantly enhance auditing.

You can enable Proxy protocol on Percona XtraDB Cluster by adding
`proxy_protocol_networks <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/flexibility/proxy_protocol_support.html#proxy_protocol_networks>`_ 
option to :ref:`pxc-configuration` key in the ``deploy/cr.yaml`` configuration
file.

.. note:: Depending on the load balancer of your cloud provider, you may also
   need setting :ref:`haproxy-externaltrafficpolicy` option in ``deploy/cr.yaml``.

More information about Proxy protocol can be found in the `official HAProxy documentation <https://www.haproxy.com/blog/using-haproxy-with-the-proxy-protocol-to-better-secure-your-database/>`_.
