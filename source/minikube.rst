Install Percona XtraDB Cluster on Minikube
============================================

Installing the PXC Operator on `minikube <https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube>`_
is the easiest way to try it locally without a cloud provider. Minikube runs
Kubernetes on GNU/Linux, Windows, or macOS system using a system-wide
hypervisor, such as VirtualBox, KVM/QEMU, VMware Fusion or Hyper-V. Using it is
a popular way to test the Kubernetes application locally prior to deploying it
on a cloud.

The following steps are needed to run PXC Operator on Minikube:

0. `Install Minikube <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/>`_, using a way recommended for your system. This includes the installation of the following three components:
   #. kubectl tool,
   #. a hypervisor, if it is not already installed,
   #. actual Minikube package

   After the installation running ``minikube start`` should download needed
   virtualized images, then initialize and run the cluster. After Minikube is
   successfully started, you can optionally run the Kubernetes dashboard, which
   visually represents the state of your cluster. Executing
   ``minikube dashboard`` will start the dashboard and open it in your
   default web browser.

1. Clone the percona-xtradb-cluster-operator repository::

     git clone -b release-{{release}} https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator
     cd percona-xtradb-cluster-operator

2. Deploy the operator with the following command::

     kubectl apply -f deploy/bundle.yaml

3. Because minikube runs locally, the default ``deploy/cr.yaml`` file should
   be edited to adapt the Operator for the the local installation with limited
   resources. Change the following keys in ``pxc`` and ``proxysql`` sections:

   #. comment ``resources.requests.memory`` and ``resources.requests.cpu`` keys
      (this will fit the Operator in minikube default limitations)
   #. set ``affinity.antiAffinityTopologyKey`` key to ``"none"`` (the Operator
      will be unable to spread the cluster on several nodes)

   Also, switch ``allowUnsafeConfigurations`` key to ``true`` (this option turns
   off the Operatorâ€™s control over the cluster size, making it possible to
   deploy Percona XtraDB Cluster as a one-node cluster).

4. Now apply the ``deploy/cr.yaml`` file with the following command::

     kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml

5. During previous steps, the Operator has generated several `secrets <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/>`_, including the
   password for the ``root`` user, which you will definitely need to access the
   cluster. Use ``kubectl get secrets`` to see the list of Secrets objects (by
   default Secrets object you are interested in has ``my-cluster-secrets`` name).
   Then ``kubectl get secret my-cluster-secrets -o yaml`` will return the YAML
   file with generated secrets, including the root password which should look as
   follows::

     ...
     data:
       ...
       root: cm9vdF9wYXNzd29yZA== 

   Here the actual password is base64-encoded, and
   ``echo 'cm9vdF9wYXNzd29yZA==' | base64 --decode`` will bring it back to a
   human-readable form.

6. Check connectivity to a newly created cluster.

   First of all, run percona-client and connect its console output to your
   terminal (running it may require some time to deploy the correspondent Pod): 
   
   .. code:: bash

      kubectl run -i --rm --tty percona-client --image=percona:5.7 --restart=Never -- bash -il
   
   Now run ``mysql`` tool in the percona-client command shell using the password
   obtained from the secret:
   
   .. code:: bash

      mysql -h cluster1-proxysql -uroot -proot_password
