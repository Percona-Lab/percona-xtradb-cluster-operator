`Pause/resume Percona XtraDB Cluster <pause.html#pause>`_
===============================================================================

There may be external situations when it is needed to shutdown the PXC cluster
for a while and then start it back up (some works related to the maintenance of
the enterprise infrastructure, etc.).

The ``deploy/cr.yaml`` file contains a special ``spec.pause`` key for this.
Setting it to ``true`` gracefully stops the cluster::

  spec:
    .......
    pause: true

To start the cluster after it was shut down just revert the ``spec.pause`` key
to ``false``.
