System Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++

The Operator supports Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) 5.7 and 8.0.

The new ``caching_sha2_password`` authentication plugin which is default in 8.0
is not supported for the ProxySQL compatibility reasons. Therefore both PXC 5.7
and 8.0 are configured with
``default_authentication_plugin = mysql_native_password``.

Officially supported platforms
--------------------------------

The following platforms are supported:

* OpenShift 3.11
* OpenShift 4.2
* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) 1.15
* GKE 1.17
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) 1.15
* Minikube 1.16

Other Kubernetes platforms may also work but have not been tested.

Resource Limits
-----------------------

A cluster running an officially supported platform contains at least three 
Nodes, with the following resources:

* 2GB of RAM,
* 2 CPU threads per Node for Pods provisioning,
* at least 60GB of available storage for Persistent Volumes provisioning.

Platform-specific limitations
------------------------------

The Operator is subsequent to specific platform limitations.

* Minikube doesn't support multi-node cluster configurations because of its
  local nature, which is in collision with the default affinity requirements
  of the Operator. To arrange this, the :ref:`install-minikube` instruction
  includes an additional step which turns off the requirement of having not
  less than three Nodes.
