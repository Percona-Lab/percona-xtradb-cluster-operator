Scale Percona XtraDB Cluster on Kubernetes and OpenShift
========================================================

One of the great advantages brought by Kubernetes and the OpenShift
platform is the ease of an application scaling. Scaling a Deployment up
or down ensures new Pods are created and set to available Kubernetes
nodes.

Size of the cluster is controlled by a :ref:`size key<pxc-size>` in the :ref:`operator.custom-resource-options` configuration. Thatâ€™s why scaling the cluster needs
nothing more but changing this option and applying the updated
configuration file. This may be done in a specifically saved config, or
on the fly, using the following command:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl patch pxc cluster1 --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/pxc/size", "value": 5 }]'

In this example we have changed the size of the Percona XtraDB Cluster
to ``5`` nodes.

.. warning:: Using ``kubectl scale StatefulSet_name`` command to rescale
   Percona XtraDB Cluster is not recommended, as it makes ``size``
   configuration option out of sync, and the next config change may result
   in reverting the previous number of nodes.

Increase the Persistent Volume Claim size
-----------------------------------------

Kubernetes manages storage with a PersistentVolume (PV), a segment of
storage supplied by the administrator, and a PersistentVolumeClaim
(PVC), a request for storage from a user. In Kubernetes v1.11 the
feature was added to allow a user to increase the size of an existing
PVC object. The user cannot shrink the size of an existing PVC object.
Certain volume types support, be default, expanding PVCs (details about
PVCs and the supported volume types can be found in `Kubernetes
documentation <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#expanding-persistent-volumes-claims>`__)

The following are the steps to increase the size:

0. Extract and backup the yaml file for the cluster

   .. code:: bash

      kubectl get pxc cluster1 -o yaml --export > CR_backup.yaml

1. Delete the cluster

   .. code:: bash

      kubectl delete -f CR_backup.yaml

2. For each node, edit the yaml to resize the PVC object.

   .. code:: bash

      kubectl edit pvc datadir-cluster1-pxc-0

   In the yaml, edit the spec.resources.requests.storage value.

   .. code:: bash

      spec:
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 6Gi

   Perform the same operation on the other nodes.

   .. code:: bash

      kubectl edit pvc datadir-cluster1-pxc-1
      kubectl edit pvc datadir-cluster1-pxc-2

3. In the CR configuration file, use vim or another text editor to edit
   the PVC size.

   .. code:: bash

      vim CR_backup.yaml

4. Apply the updated configuration to the cluster.

   .. code:: bash

      kubectl apply -f CR_backup.yaml
