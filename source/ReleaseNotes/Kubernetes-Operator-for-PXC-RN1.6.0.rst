.. _K8SPXC-1.6.0:

================================================================================
*Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona XtraDB Cluster* 1.6.0
================================================================================

:Date: October 9, 2020
:Installation: `Installing Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona XtraDB Cluster <https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/index.html#quickstart-guides>`_

New Features
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-394`: Support of :ref:`"cluster-wide" mode<install-clusterwide>` for Percona XtraDB Cluster Operator
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-416`: :ref:`Support of the proxy-protocol<haproxy-conf-protocol>` in HAProxy (to use this feature, you should have a Percona XtraDB Cluster image version ``8.0.21`` or newer)

* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-429`: A possibility to :ref:`restore backups to a new Kubernetes-based environment<backups-restore>` with no existing Percona XtraDB Cluster Custom Resource
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-343`: Helm chart :ref:`officially provided with the Operator<install-helm>`

Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-144`: Allow :ref:`adding ProxySQL configuration options<proxysql-conf-custom>`
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-398`: New ``crVersion key`` in ``deploy/cr.yaml`` to indicate the API version that the Custom Resource corresponds to (thanks to user mike.saah for contribution)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-474`: The init container now has the same resource requests as the main container of a correspondent Pod (thanks to user yann.leenhardt for contribution)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-372`: Support new versions of cert-manager by the Operator (thanks to user rf_enigm for contribution)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-317`: Possibility to configure the ``imagePullPolicy`` Operator option (thanks to user imranrazakhan for contribution)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-462`: Add readiness probe for HAProxy
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-411`: Extend cert-manager configuration to add additional domains (multiple SAN) to a certificate
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-375`: Improve HAProxy behavior in case of switching writer node to a new one and back
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-368`: Autoupdate system users by changing the appropriate Secret name

Known Issues and Limitations
================================================================================

* OpenShift 3.11 requires additional configuration for the correct HAProxy operation:
  the feature gate ``PodShareProcessNamespace`` should be set to ``true``. If
  getting it enabled is not possible, we recommend using ProxySQL instead of
  HAProxy with OpenShift 3.11. Other OpenShift and Kubernetes versions are not affected.
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-491`: Compressed backups are not compatible with the Operator 1.6.0
  (``percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator:1.5.0-pxc8.0-backup`` or
  ``percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator:1.5.0-pxc5.7-backup`` image can be
  used as a workaround if needed).

Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-431`: HAProxy unable to start on OpenShift with the default ``cr.yaml`` file
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-408`: Insufficient MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS=10 for ProxySQL monitor user (increased to 100)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-391`: HAProxy and PMM cannot be enabled at the same time (thanks to user rf_enigm for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-406`: Second node (XXX-pxc-1) always selected as a donor (thanks to user pservit for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-390`: Crash on missing HAProxy PodDisruptionBudget
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-355`: Counterintuitive YYYY-DD-MM dates in the S3 backup folder names (thanks to user graham-web for contribution)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-305`: ProxySQL not working in case of passwords with a ``%`` symbol in the Secrets object (thanks to user ben.wilson for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-278`: ProxySQL never getting ready status in some environments after the cluster launch due to the ``proxysql-monit`` Pod crash (thanks to user lots0logs for contribution)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-274`: The 1.2.0 -> 1.3.0 -> 1.4.0 upgrade path not working (thanks to user martin.atroo for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-476`: SmartUpdate failing to fetch version from Version Service in case of incorrectly formatted Percona XtraDB Cluster patch version higher than the last known one
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-454`: After the cluster creation, pxc-0 Pod restarting due to Operator not waiting for cert-manager to issue requested certificates (thanks to user mike.saah for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-450`: TLS annotations causing unnecessary HAProxy Pod restarts
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-443` and :jirabug:`K8SPXC-456`: The outdated version service endpoint URL (fix with preserving backward compatibility)

* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-418`: HAProxy not routing traffic for 1 donor, 2 joiners
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-417`: Cert-manager not compatible with Kubernetes versions below v1.15 due to unnecessarily high API version demand
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-384`: Debug images were not fully functional for the latest version of the Operator because of having no infinity loop
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-383`: DNS warnings in PXC Pods when using HAProxy
* :jirabug:`K8SPXC-364`: Smart Updates showing empty "from" versions for non-PXC objects in logs
